- [Link Cannon][1] is a Breath of the Wild mod intended to simulate BTB setups to help with speedrun routing.
  - The idea came up during a Best Theoretical Time (BTT) discussion in the Breath of the Wild Speedrunning Discord server.
  - A new BTB from Oman Au Shrine to Keh Namut Shrine was found. Unfortunately, it was extremely inconsistent, and the best one anybody got only saved one frame.
  - Somebody suggested the idea of a speed clip into the Keh Namut Shrine door. For obvious reasons, this was highly impractical, and there was essentially no chance of it happening.
  - Somebody else gave a new idea: a mod that would let you input variables and would simulate a BTB. This would allow for fine-tuning of the settings until a desired result was reached.
  - This idea was the foundation for the creation of this mod. I named it after a joke from Prahaha, an active BotWSR community member, while he was referring to my mod.
